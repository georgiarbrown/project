20,weng_2025_global.pdf,"What environmental impacts (GHG emissions, carbon sequestration, nutrient leaching) were measured?","Biochar significantly increased carbon sequestration in soils, reduced N2O emissions, and decreased nitrate and phosphate leaching, especially in high-rainfall areas. The study reported that these environmental benefits were consistent across field trials and long-term monitoring data.",yes,,
